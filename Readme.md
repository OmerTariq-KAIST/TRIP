## TRIP: Towards Realtime Deep Inertial Odometry for Pose-Invariant Pedestrian Navigation

This is the Pytorch implementation of HResCSA Model for realtime inertial navigation. 

# Dataset
1. HResCSA is evaluated on four inertial odometry datssets.
2. OxIOD dataset can be downloaded from [OxIOD](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1UCHY3ENCybcBNyiC2wx1gQEWSLqzJag0)
3. RoNIN dataset can be downloaded from [RoNIN](https://ronin.cs.sfu.ca/#dataset)
4. RIDI dataset can be downloaded from [RIDI](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kmader/ridi-data-overview/data)

# Publication
The manuscript "TRIP: Towards Realtime Deep Inertial Odometry for Pose-Invariant Pedestrian Navigation" is currently submitted to IEEE Sensor Journal for possible publication.
